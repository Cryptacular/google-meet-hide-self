# Google Meet Hide Self (Chrome extension)

Have you ever had a mirror in front of you in a meeting? Probably not. Why then should you always be looking at yourself in a video call in Google Meet?

This repo contains the code for a Chrome extension that will automatically hide the tile with your own face in it, once there are other people in the call. Please note that your video will still be on (unless you've specifically turned it off).

The Chrome extension is still pending review. A link to the listing on the Chrome Web Store will be added once published.
